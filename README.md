## FlyFF Universe Awakes

This is an app to showcase all of the possible skills / attributes that can be rolled on weapons and shields, as well as their possible skill awake percentages by rarity.

## How the bonuses work

> Weapons and Shields now have a chance to drop with a special bonus. Weapons can drop with a bonus to the damage / effect of any skill that can be used with that weapon. The bonuses possible are limited to the weapon level. If a skill requires level 65 to be obtained then the weapon needs to be at least level 65 to have a chance to get a bonus for that skill. Shields have a chance of dropping with a Block bonus or Reflect Damage bonus. Sticks can have a Healing bonus. Regarding blades only the right hand weapon has an effect. Item rarity limits the maximum possible value of the bonus (Common/Uncommon/Rare/Unique).
